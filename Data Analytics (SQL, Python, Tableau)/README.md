## 📂 Project Index

### 📊 [NBA Team Performance Analysis](./NBA_Team_Performance)
**Tools Used:** SQL  
**Topic:** Sports Analytics | NBA  
**Badge:** 🏅 Python Specialist

#### Summary:
Analyzed NBA game data (2004–2020) to examine trends in scoring, win rates, and the growing importance of 3-point shooting. The project aimed to uncover the relationship between shooting efficiency and team success.

#### Key Highlights:
- Processed 23,000+ NBA game records.
- Analyzed season-wise scoring and win percentages.
- Found that while higher 3-point shooting correlates with more wins, it's not a guarantee of success.
- Built seasonal summaries for team performance.
